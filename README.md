Personal Goals (Updated: Jan 9, 2020)
==============

Personal goals made open source. For 2019, I used my [Full Focus Planner](https://fullfocusplanner.com/) to track my goals. For 2018, I used GitHub to plan my goals and record [my achievements](https://github.com/candicodeit/personal-goals/blob/master/2018/00-2018-achievements.md). For 2020, I wanted to go back to my GitHub so I can better document and access my plans. I started listening to the audiobook of [12 Week Year](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10009377-the-12-week-year). I'm always iterating my goal setting.

# Personal Foursquare 
I wanted to create a foursquare to give more focus to any goals I set.

| Myself   | Relationships | Career  | World |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Practice self-care  | Create experiences  | Become a coach  | Practice RAK |
| Become healthy  | Plan social outings  | Create meaningful product  | Volunteer for Roc Solid  |


# Reading Goal :books:
I *LOVE* reading so I always make sure to have a reading goal every year. It's hard to set a list of books to read because I have different reading moods. It's like meal planning for the week but you really just want to have pizza. I thought I should create more general reading goals so I can make time to read. 
- Read longer fiction (500+ pgs)
- Balance between non-fiction/fiction and listening/reading

[Goal: 2/32 books](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/11621-2020-reading-challenge) 

_reading stats_
- 1 fiction / 1 non-fiction
- 1 read /  1 listen
- 0 re-reads

# 2020 Goals :trophy:
These are the goals I'd like to focus on this year. Though I'm trying to use the 12 Week Year Method, I already had these written out before coming across this new approach. 

- [ ] Help Roc Solid Foundation become more successful (achievement)
	- Though I still practice random acts of kindness, I've really gained a new sense of fulfillment when I volunteer for Roc Solid. It's more than just helping build a play set. I've helped with running events more efficiently and also created better workflows and solutions for day-to-day operations. I may not always be helping kids directly but I know it allows the staff to do so. 
   - Milestones: 
    - update Ready Bag Program workflow
    - obtain 120 donation items for the silent auction
    - raise $45k at the auction
    - create roadmap fo iterating the Play It Forward workflow
    - invite 5 more friends to get involved
    - raise $50k at the telethon

- [ ] Improve my mental health (habit)
	- I started meditating after reading [Make Time](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time). I think it has helped me worry less and provide me a calm that I've been seeking. I feel different on the days I don't meditate. Headspace has been a great way to help me with my practice. I've also been doing [Future Self Journaling](https://yourholisticpsychologist.com/future-self-journaling/) to be more mindful of my habits and what I can do to adjust them. 
   - Milestones (per quarter): 
    - complete 250 meditation sessions
    - write 84 future self journal entries
    - sleep 53 hrs
   
- [ ] Achieve 32% body fat index (achievement)
	- Working from home means less movement. With my toddler getting faster, I want to be able to catch up. I also want to sleep better.
      - Milestones: 
         - lose 1% body fat
         - complete 6 weeks of intermittent fasting
         - lose 3% body fat
         - down to size 10

- [ ] Obtain CAPM Certification (achievement)
	- I obviously love planning and I also love helping people. I've really enjoyed project planning both for A Book Apart and for events at Roc Solid. Because I am not a project manager full time, I want to learn more about what's involved in being one. Regardless of where my career path will take me, I think these skills could be useful in any position I take on. 
      - Milestones: 
         - complete CAPM Udemy course
         - write all 14 sets of study cards

- [ ] Spend more time with family and friends (habit)
	- Now that I work remotely, my relationships are more important to me. I need to make sure I stay in touch with those close to me. Last year, I came across the [Social Gathering Checklist](social-checklist.md) and found it as a great guideline to keep in touch with people. It's hard to do all of those in a month since coordinating with other friends who also have kids is nearly impossible. I don't want to create more stress on myself just to meet with others.

- [ ] Write more blog posts (habit)
	- I always have a lot on my mind. I also like sharing my experiences with friends and co-workers to help them with their own personal development journey. I think if I write more, it would help my communication skills and hopefully help others that I don't get to share my journey with.

# 12 Week Year
The idea behind 12 Week Year is setting goals per 12 weeks versus the full year. Instead of separating my planning monthly or by quarter as previous years, I'm listing them out as 12 weeks. 

   * [12 Weeks](https://github.com/candicodeit/personal-goals/blob/master/2020/01-12wy-q1.md)
   * [This Week](https://github.com/candicodeit/personal-goals/blob/master/2020/01-12wy-q1.md#week-2--jan-13---19)
