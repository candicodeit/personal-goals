# 2019 Goals :trophy:
- [x] Complete my [Full Focus Planner](https://fullfocusplanner.com/) for the quarter
	- using a new goal system/planner, I wanted to make sure I fully utilize the planner before determining if it's the right system for me. 
- [x] Meditate 28 days a month or 450 minutes a month
	- I started meditating after reading [Make Time](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time). I think it has helped me worry less and provide me a calm that I've been seeking. I feel different on the days I don't meditate. Headspace has been a great way to help me with my practice.	
- [ ] Achieve 32% body fat index 
	- working from home means less movement. with my toddler getting faster, I want to be able to catch up. I also want to sleep better.
- [ ] Complete 3 UX courses from [Interaction Design Foundation](https://www.interaction-design.org/)
	- I've always had a passion for UX and want to learn more. IDF provides various courses to help professionals more about UX at their own pace. 
	- Completed Design Thinking
	- Current progress 62% Human-Computer Interaction
- [ ] Plan more family/friends/date activity once a month
	- Now that I work remotely, my relationships are more important to me. I need to make sure I stay in touch with those close to me.
