Personal goals made open source. Inspired by [Una Kravets](https://una.im/personal-goals-guide/).

I've always been a planner ever since high school. I started out using traditional planners but now my goals and different parts of my life make it difficult to use a traditional planner. I started using [Leuchttrum1917](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/notebook-medium-a5-hardcover-249-numbered-pages.html) and bullet journalling for goal setting and planning. As of 2018, I've used the [4-part Yearly Theme method](https://inkandvolt.com/2017/12/your-2018-success-strategy-yearly-planning-part-4/) twice. It has now morphed into using my GitHub account for Yearly, Monthly, and Weekly planning, since it says time on writing it all out. I've tried Bullet Journaling but sometimes I don't have the time to re-write everything every week. Plus I wanted a different type of visual for the things I wanted to accomplish and was not happy with the various layouts I tried to tracked streaks and document dates. 

I started in January with Overarching Goals and switched to Personal Foursquare starting in August. I switched to the Foursquare, since I've heard it helps sort through your many tasks. It helps you focus on ones that get you towards your goal. Reading is also really important to me, regardless if it's fiction or non-fiction. It's great for both work and personal reasons. I can get lost in a fictional world to give my brain a break from things through various concepts and workflows. I also still enjoy reading things relevant to work whether it is about working with different people or understanding different design techniques.

For 2019, I switched to using the [Full Focus Planner](https://fullfocusplanner.com). This allows me to write out my goals in baby steps, my key motivations for the goals, and write out my reward for writing each goal. The planner allows me to estimate my tasks, plan them by the half hour, and document my daily rituals. This planner is only quarterly so I hope to see the outcome after 90 days. I'm always open to try different methods to see what works for me. I've also incorporated some tactics I've read from [Make Time](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time?from_search=true) and [Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits?from_search=true). I liked completing projects in quarters but I missed having the ease of writing out my plans via GitHub. 

For 2020, I'm going to use what I learn from my Full Focus Planner, incorporate some of the methodology from [12 Week Year](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10009377-the-12-week-year), and switch back to logging via GitHub. I often found I would get tired of writing things down over and over. I like to save my writing for reflecting and doing my future self journal entries. Here's to productive 12 weeks!
