## Weekly Plan

### Week 1 | Mar 30 - Apr 5

  _Reflection_   
- I did not start planning Q2 yet, but that's ok. It's all about taking one day at a time. I also wanted to clear my head and figure out what path I wanted to take.

_Reflection_   
- what success or positive results have you seen so far?
    - I've worked through a lot of Scrum Framework course through Pluralsight. I've also taken more of an acting Scrum Master role on the team. I feel pretty confident that I can do well in this career path. It also allows me to continue coach training because it would be useful with people interactions.
- what pitfalls did you encounter?
    - Did not get as much sleep this past week. 
- what would you do differently for the next 12 weeks?
    - I will try to keep up with using a weekly tracking method so I can continue to work towards my goals. I can be mindful of what work needs to be done and what I've accomplished so far.
- do you feel any different about your goals than you did week 1?
    - After going through PI, I feel more confident in my career path vs using it as a detour or alternative to get me to where I want to go. Trying to compare UX and Project Management/Scrum was a difficult decision. The perks of working as a Scrum Master include working with the team and using my emotional intelligence to motivate and connect with others. 
- other reflections
    - I'm finally feeling productive to the team and excited about what my future holds. I know there's a lot happening with the Coronavirus but trying to make the most of it.
