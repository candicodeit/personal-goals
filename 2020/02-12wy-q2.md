## Weekly Plan

### Week 1 | Mar 30 - Apr 5

  _Reflection_   
- I did not start planning Q2 yet, but that's ok. It's all about taking one day at a time. I also wanted to clear my head and figure out what path I wanted to take. I did a lot of reflecting throughout the week about my career. Where I've been. Where I want to go. The directions I wanted to choose.

_Reflection_   
- what success or positive results have you seen so far?
    - I've worked through a lot of Scrum Framework course through Pluralsight. I've also taken more of an acting Scrum Master role on the team. I feel pretty confident that I can do well in this career path. It also allows me to continue coach training because it would be useful with people interactions.
- what pitfalls did you encounter?
    - Did not get as much sleep this past week. 
- what would you do differently for the next 12 weeks?
    - I will try to keep up with using a weekly tracking method so I can continue to work towards my goals. I can be mindful of what work needs to be done and what I've accomplished so far.
- do you feel any different about your goals than you did week 1?
    - After going through PI, I feel more confident in my career path vs using it as a detour or alternative to get me to where I want to go. Trying to compare UX and Project Management/Scrum was a difficult decision. The perks of working as a Scrum Master include working with the team and using my emotional intelligence to motivate and connect with others. 
- other reflections
    - I'm finally feeling productive to the team and excited about what my future holds. I know there's a lot happening with the Coronavirus but trying to make the most of it.

    - [ ] sun 6:39

_Reflection_   
- what success or positive results have you seen so far?
    - I finished my Scrum Master certification and passed on the first go! I was definitely so excited for what I've accomplished. All the hard work paid off. It was such a huge relief. I've paid for a lot of online courses before like Udemy or Interaction Design Foundation. I've only obtained 2 certificates from IDF. Nothing from other courses. I actually finished the Scrum Foundation path during my free month of Pluralsight. I guess it shows what determination does, despite the price tag. I have just a week left before the free membership is over but I plan on finishing a few more Scrum-related courses. I want to go for my PSM (Professional Scrum Master I) certification. I heard the test is harder but it doesn't expire once you get it. 
- what pitfalls did you encounter?
    - I didn't do any reading since I focused on brushing up on Scrum courses through Pluralsight. Once I realize I could treat the course as an audiobook, I was able to breeze through them. 
- what would you do differently for the next 12 weeks?
    - I would like to get more in-depth knowledge of Scrum by reviewing the Scrum Guide. I would also like to keep constant contact with a few people that could help me in my Scrum Master journey. 
- do you feel any different about your goals than you did week 1?
    - I've never felt so sure about a path. Though I do love UX, I love the feeling of servant leadership and coaching people to work more efficiently and effectively. 
- other reflections
    - Don't feel like I'm set back because certain things don't go my way. A bigger plan will reveal itself soon. Patience and continue to move forward.

_Reflection_   
- what success or positive results have you seen so far?
    - I've continued to keep up my scrum training and gained a studying partner from my SAFe course. It keeps me motivated to continue with my Scrum Master path. 
- what pitfalls did you encounter?
    - I'm not able to use my Scrum Master skills fully at work. Though I'm not surprised in the disappointment like many times before, it's also de-motivating at work. 
- what would you do differently for the next 12 weeks?
    - Continue with my job search and also learn from others in the industry to better market myself and understand how scrum plays in real life.
- do you feel any different about your goals than you did week 1?
    - I feel more and more motivated to pursue Scrum Master role because of the aspect of servant leadership. 
- other reflections
    - I've taken a "Navigating Career Transitions" coaching session. It has helped me validate my career path and also show me that I'm not alone in my transitions and hesitation in pursuing a career shift. I've also met another coach during the session who is also a recruiter. Maybe I can gain some insight to better position my profile.
