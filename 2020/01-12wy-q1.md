 _Reflection_   
- what success or positive results have you seen so far?
    - I'm able to handle fasting for an extended period of time. I didn't quite feel low energy since I would drink coffee marjority of the time. I was able to complete my reading goals. 
- what pitfalls did you encounter?
    - I did not put any focus to my main goals. I also had too many habit goals I was tracking so I'm going to minimize that. It's hard to focus on multiple things.
- what would you do differently for the next 12 weeks?
    - I would definitely focus on less so I can actually bring attention to things I really want to focus on. Also, don't stress over not hitting 100%. It's about the progress. As long as I continue to pace myself in a good direction, that's great! I also want to bring more awareness to certain things as important as sleep. 
- do you feel any different about your goals than you did week 1?
    - I realize that people can only do but so much in a day or even a week. I'm of a strong opinion at work to keep the priorities a small list or else it's hard to focus or hit any deadline. 
- other reflections
    - My desire to become a life or career coach has grown or just coaching in general. I think I could really help people achieve greatest that they didn't think they had. I'd love to be people's cheerleader. I love my own goals as well as see other people achieve their goals.
