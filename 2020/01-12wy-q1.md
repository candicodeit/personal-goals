 _Reflection_   
- what success or positive results have you seen so far?
    - I'm able to handle fasting for an extended period of time. I didn't quite feel low energy since I would drink coffee marjority of the time. I was able to complete my reading goals. 
- what pitfalls did you encounter?
    - I did not put any focus to my main goals. I also had too many habit goals I was tracking so I'm going to minimize that. It's hard to focus on multiple things.
- what would you do differently for the next 12 weeks?
    - I would definitely focus on less so I can actually bring attention to things I really want to focus on. Also, don't stress over not hitting 100%. It's about the progress. As long as I continue to pace myself in a good direction, that's great! I also want to bring more awareness to certain things as important as sleep. 
- do you feel any different about your goals than you did week 1?
    - I realize that people can only do but so much in a day or even a week. I'm of a strong opinion at work to keep the priorities a small list or else it's hard to focus or hit any deadline. 
- other reflections
    - My desire to become a life or career coach has grown or just coaching in general. I think I could really help people achieve greatest that they didn't think they had. I'd love to be people's cheerleader. I love my own goals as well as see other people achieve their goals.

  _Reflection_   
- what success or positive results have you seen so far?
    - I've been able to spend a lot of quality time with my husband. We don't always go out but we do have a few TV shows we enjoy together. I've also seen a positive reaction to the new workflow I've created for Roc Solid. We're also using a new software for the gala that should improve the workflow a lot. As far as sleep, whenever I get close to 7 hrs or somehow many up the missed time with a nap, I feel more refreshed. I think 7 hrs is my sweet spot for sleep and energy. I also refreshed an opportunity so we'll see what comes of it.
- what pitfalls did you encounter?
    - I didn't focus on any future self journaling, though I did have a few days where I just journaled. I still haven't come close to picking a topic for a blog post. 0 focus on the CAPM since I've been thinking about coaching and all the other stuff for Roc Solid. I also removed keto from the list. I will continue off/on fasting instead. 
- what would you do differently for the next 12 weeks?
    - I need to review my goals every morning to keep them fresh in my mind. I also need to understand why I put certain things off. I received a new planner yesterday so we'll see if this will help, too. 
- do you feel any different about your goals than you did week 1?
    - I know what I'm trying to achieve with my goals. I'm happy to eliminate stuff that I know I can't focus on. It's not necessarily about getting 100% all the time but it's about obtaining focus and making progress. Progress is what's most important and as long as I'm making moves on something, it's progress.
- other reflections
    - I realize more now that my step-daughter around how bad phones are. When I was at my in-laws, she was on her phone 95% of the time. Only time she wasn't was when we ate dinner. I need to game less, read more, but also put it away when I'm around family. I would like to add a "no phone" during meals and watching movies or TV as a family. I don't want Emmi to live a life from just screens.

  _Reflection_   
- what success or positive results have you seen so far?
    - I got a great amount of sleep. The week didn't start off that way but I felt like I made up for it towards the end of the week. It felt great and I had a lot more energy than normal. I also received great feedback on the Ready Bag dashboard I built for Roc Solid. It's a step in the direction to making better processes work more efficiently. 
- what pitfalls did you encounter?
    - Though I completed the 16 hr fasts, I think I could have cut back on sweets. I didn't have multiple within a day but I did tend to have sweets during the end of my day, which probably isn't the best before bed. I also didn't have consistent reading time during the week so I didn't finish my book on Saturday as I hoped. 
- what would you do differently for the next 12 weeks?
    - I want to make more of an effort to get through training and get some work done. 
- do you feel any different about your goals than you did week 1?
    - I feel like I'm tracking the right habits and shifting as needed. I'm trying to bring more awareness to my goals and why I'm trying to focus on them. It's important to understand internal needs.
- other reflections
    - I practice gratitude every day. Though I read a quote yesterday that was pretty deep: "The more things we desire and the more we have to do to earn or attain those achievements, the less we actually enjoy our lives - and the less free we are." - The Daily Stoic Jan 25. I think I need to dig deeper. It's more than just taking 5 mins to be grateful for things. Truly appreciate the now and what I have. We can have goals but are we setting the right goals?! What's the purpose and how will it change me to a better person?

  _Reflection_   
- what success or positive results have you seen so far?
    - I had a great reading month! Grant it I went through some short audiobooks. However, I went through big fiction books, all over 500 pages. I did a lot of reflection over the past week as well. I attend a leadership workshop through Roc Solid. They went over a lot about finding your true north and toughing through the pain to reach your destination. I've gravitated a lot towards coaching. I even had my first coaching session, which I felt went well. I hope to learn more about coaching and practicing asking questions. I was also able to finish up the Ready Bag dashboard. I'm excited for the team to use it and hopefully gain more hospitals.
- what pitfalls did you encounter?
    - Lacking sleep really affects my productivity. Even though I didn't fast and ate breakfast, I didn't have enough energy to fully complete what I wanted. I also didn't schedule time for training or refining my blog post. Though I didn't focus on those things, I still felt accomplished for the week. Depending on how everything goes, I might have to re-evaluate what my priorities are.
- what would you do differently for the next 12 weeks?
    - I need more sleep. Establishing a bed time would help. Since I don't have my Ready Bag project or necessary reading, I can focus more on training for Scrum Master.
- do you feel any different about your goals than you did week 1?
    - Overall, I think I can focus on 2 goals per week vs 3. I have to be sure that those are the things I want to focus on. 
- other reflections
    - I'm doing a lot of audiobooks based on coaching. I have more drive to it now that I did before. I don't want logistics to hold me back. I just need to dive in!
