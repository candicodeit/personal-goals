 _Reflection_   
- what success or positive results have you seen so far?
    - I'm able to handle fasting for an extended period of time. I didn't quite feel low energy since I would drink coffee marjority of the time. I was able to complete my reading goals. 
- what pitfalls did you encounter?
    - I did not put any focus to my main goals. I also had too many habit goals I was tracking so I'm going to minimize that. It's hard to focus on multiple things.
- what would you do differently for the next 12 weeks?
    - I would definitely focus on less so I can actually bring attention to things I really want to focus on. Also, don't stress over not hitting 100%. It's about the progress. As long as I continue to pace myself in a good direction, that's great! I also want to bring more awareness to certain things as important as sleep. 
- do you feel any different about your goals than you did week 1?
    - I realize that people can only do but so much in a day or even a week. I'm of a strong opinion at work to keep the priorities a small list or else it's hard to focus or hit any deadline. 
- other reflections
    - My desire to become a life or career coach has grown or just coaching in general. I think I could really help people achieve greatest that they didn't think they had. I'd love to be people's cheerleader. I love my own goals as well as see other people achieve their goals.

  _Reflection_   
- what success or positive results have you seen so far?
    - I've been able to spend a lot of quality time with my husband. We don't always go out but we do have a few TV shows we enjoy together. I've also seen a positive reaction to the new workflow I've created for Roc Solid. We're also using a new software for the gala that should improve the workflow a lot. As far as sleep, whenever I get close to 7 hrs or somehow many up the missed time with a nap, I feel more refreshed. I think 7 hrs is my sweet spot for sleep and energy. I also refreshed an opportunity so we'll see what comes of it.
- what pitfalls did you encounter?
    - I didn't focus on any future self journaling, though I did have a few days where I just journaled. I still haven't come close to picking a topic for a blog post. 0 focus on the CAPM since I've been thinking about coaching and all the other stuff for Roc Solid. I also removed keto from the list. I will continue off/on fasting instead. 
- what would you do differently for the next 12 weeks?
    - I need to review my goals every morning to keep them fresh in my mind. I also need to understand why I put certain things off. I received a new planner yesterday so we'll see if this will help, too. 
- do you feel any different about your goals than you did week 1?
    - I know what I'm trying to achieve with my goals. I'm happy to eliminate stuff that I know I can't focus on. It's not necessarily about getting 100% all the time but it's about obtaining focus and making progress. Progress is what's most important and as long as I'm making moves on something, it's progress.
- other reflections
    - I realize more now that my step-daughter around how bad phones are. When I was at my in-laws, she was on her phone 95% of the time. Only time she wasn't was when we ate dinner. I need to game less, read more, but also put it away when I'm around family. I would like to add a "no phone" during meals and watching movies or TV as a family. I don't want Emmi to live a life from just screens.
