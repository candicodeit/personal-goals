# July Reflection
I learned a lot this month. I made a dash for catching up on my reading list. Within that list, it was mostly non-fiction (again). Sometimes, I just can't help reading team building, culture, management, etc. type books. They're just fascinating in our other work dynamics are compared to what I'm used to. One of the things I learned this month is creating a 4-sq. This will ultimately help me figure out what's most important to me and how I can complete my tasks to work towards those goals. AEA gave me a lot of inspiration. We'll see what the remainder of the year will bring. 

In terms of my documentation, I'll probably leave some of the uncompleted monthly stuff off the latest version so I can concentrate on my achievements rather than reflecting too much on my uncompleted items.
