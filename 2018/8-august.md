# August Reflection
I feel like August was a good month. Did a bit of reflection for the year. Created my foursquare to get better focus. I eliminated a few distractions and was truly able to focus on things that made me happy. I caught up with my reading with more fiction as well as actual reading vs listening to audiobooks. Sometimes reading too much non-fiction can work my brain overtime that it doesn't get to have downtime. I felt great volunteering for a great foundation and also donating to a school library down in North Carolina. I love helping people. 

Now that I have a better focus on what I'm interested in for my career path, I've been able to take my learning more seriously. I've taken the time to actually complete a few courses to make me better. The more I learn about myself, the more I realize how UX is a perfect fit for me. One of my top 5 strengths is _Empathy_, a popular topic related to creating better experiences. 

Hope to end the year pretty strong.
