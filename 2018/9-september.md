# September Reflection
This is the second month I've used the 4sq format of planning. I have to say that it's working quite well. I've looked through my previous months in terms of accomplishments. I've accomplished just as many tasks as I did at the beginning of the year. I'd like to see how this goes in Dec if I'm still producing the same amount of completion. I do like the better focus of tasks related to my overall goals for each area of my life. 

As for my career development, though I haven't finished my Designlab course, I feel really great about the work I've been doing vs when I took an IDF course. The interaction with my mentor is the biggest impact for me. I hope to finish strong and possibly have a product to work towards when I'm finished. October is an event heavy month so we'll see how well it will go.
