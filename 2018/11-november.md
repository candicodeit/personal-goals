### Week 46: Reflection
I write daily reflection in any of my million notebooks I own. I write my monthly reflection in here. I don't think daily reflection would necessarily be feasible. Well it can but maybe I want to keep those to myself for now. Maybe weekly reflection here would be worth reviewing as I start the new week. Volunteering for Roc Solid has definitely become something more meaningful to me. It fills my heart to be able to help this great foundation. Though my original intent for focusing on "world" was to help women and girls progress in tech. I still want to do that. However, for now, I want more local awareness to Roc Solid. I want them to get more volunteers and more generous donors so they can continue to help kids battling cancer. 

I also noticed a better focus while reviewing all the things I've read in [Make Time: How to Focus on What Matters Every Day](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time). Using the burner tactic for focusing on projects has been helpful. I've also made a better effort to meditate with the [Headspace app](https://www.headspace.com/). My mind can get so easily distracted or flustered. I need help reflecting and re-focusing on the things that matter.
