### Week 46: Reflection
I write daily reflection in any of my million notebooks I own. I write my monthly reflection in here. I don't think daily reflection would necessarily be feasible. Well it can but maybe I want to keep those to myself for now. Maybe weekly reflection here would be worth reviewing as I start the new week. Volunteering for Roc Solid has definitely become something more meaningful to me. It fills my heart to be able to help this great foundation. Though my original intent for focusing on "world" was to help women and girls progress in tech. I still want to do that. However, for now, I want more local awareness to Roc Solid. I want them to get more volunteers and more generous donors so they can continue to help kids battling cancer. 

I also noticed a better focus while reviewing all the things I've read in [Make Time: How to Focus on What Matters Every Day](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time). Using the burner tactic for focusing on projects has been helpful. I've also made a better effort to meditate with the [Headspace app](https://www.headspace.com/). My mind can get so easily distracted or flustered. I need help reflecting and re-focusing on the things that matter.

### Week 47: Reflection
Last week was mostly vacation but I did still complete a few things. I was able to clean most of the house before we left for my in-laws so I was less overwhelmed by the house when we returned. I didn't get to meditate as much as I would have liked due to being in a different environment. I just need to figure out a way to be alone to do those things when I'm out of town. I still occasionally read through "Make Time" but didn't quite finish. I mostly focused on getting through most of the kids on the Christmas shopping list. I was a little more mindful about the budget vs buying whatever suits the kid. I've been trying to start my day with more reading/listening vs infinity pool surfing. I finished a 19 hour book within a week. 

This week, I hope I'm able to take care of the house throughout the week vs waiting till Friday. I will continue with the "Burner" tactic to work through my Highlight. I will see what other tactics I can use for better Laser focus.

### Week 48: Reflection
I'm really trying to make meditating into a habit. I think it'll help with my mindfulness as well as my mental health. I often work through the day without a break so maybe this will help me separate from the day better. I'm continuing with scheduling my day with my estimated tasks. I did down a few apps last week on my laptop and phone to see where my time is spent. I really want to work through the "Laser" tactics from [Make Time](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time). Closing my tabs at the end of the day even within my phone has been helpful from being distracted or sucked into an infinity pool for the start of the day. 

After my coaching session with Lara last week, I've been figuring out projects I'd like to work on. I've read a lot about side projects helping with your creativity within your full time job. Maybe that's why people have side hustles aside just the extra money. It also helps with the monotomy of working on the same product for many years.

# November Reflection
Re-reading/listening Make Time, I believe, has made a huge difference in my goal planning and actual action. I'd like to see how I can mold my goal planning for 2019. I think Dec, I'll focus more on the "Laser" tactics before moving onto "Energize" and "Reflect". I also realize how I want to improve my relationships since I work remotely. My in-person relationships since I lack that in my day-to-day for work. I personally need that interaction to take my mind off of work monotony. I also think that last year, I want to focus more on re-reading my non-fiction that can be helpful towards my life. I like making sure I have better balance with my fiction because it's the brain break I need for all the daily worry. I need to be better at scheduling those things.

I think side projects are going to be more important for my development in 2019. Learning how to juggle those will be important without my personal relationships suffering. I need to be better about managing my time when it comes to start/stop, especially stop.
