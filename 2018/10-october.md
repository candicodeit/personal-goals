# October Reflection
My balance of reading shifted from fiction to non-fiction. I feel pretty good considering one of the books is about Make Time. I want to make time for my goals and my career overall. I want to go where my passions lie and how I can help people become better. I've realized how much I enjoy helping people develop themselves. I know I don't have myself 100% figured out but I feel like I have at least a plan to get there. Maybe 75% so I have wiggle room. I think I might consider moving up my desire to be a coach sooner in my timeline. Maybe not as a full time coach but possibly part time so I can better help those around me find their passion. I like listening to others and helping them talk through what makes them most excited about their daily lives. Sometimes you just need a nudge to get you into the right direction. I'm more than happy to help those do that. 

I also thought a lot about promoting my skills better. I think a lot of my self-doubt stems from not fully being aware of what my strengths are or things I do almost daily without realizing it. I'm glad I put together the list of completed tasks for 2018. It really brings to light of how far I've come. It's always important to celebrate the wins. I'm looking to start some major reflection of the year this month. This year was figuring things out. 2019 is going to be epic!
