# February Reflection

Being on a week long non-holiday vacation is something I realized is necessary for everyone at least once a year. Because of the nice vacation we had with family, I worked less on my goals because I was either prepping, experiencing or recovering from vacation. I have done better with reading a chapter or 15mins when I wake up and before bed. It's a more relaxing activity than checking my phone. I've also made more of an effort to work remotely with other folks aside from those that work at the same company. It relieves the loneliness I get from working from home by myself. It also sparks interesting conversations about UX and web from different perspectives. I'll try to work with at least 2 people a month.
