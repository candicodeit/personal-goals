# June Reflection
June seemed like a pretty hectic month from a personal stand point. Every weekend was a birthday party or other planned event. I rarely plan to attend more than 2 events in one day simply because I know I don't have the energy to do so. I know I have to get other responsibilities taken care of over the weekends like grocery shopping, cleaning, etc. The MAE format didn't quite work out always. I found one from [Lara Hogan](https://twitter.com/lara_hogan) that might be interesting: [Defrag Your Calendar](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qOXEOOYvxiA4LDgmEqK0hCYuJ44nf0Z8UM-j48kK4gw/edit). I did find estimating tasks helpful to planning my day. I can move things accordingly knowing what I do and do not have time for. My reading habits have been slacking as well. I feel that I need to have a better bed schedule so I can have time to read without falling asleep on page 1.

My other big struggle is learning. I think it relates to my blurry vision of what I want to do next in my career. I know things I'm good at and the things that get me excited. I just want to do all of the things but I know I have to prioritize it.
