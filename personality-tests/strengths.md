StrengthFinders 2.0
==============

I decided to take the StrengthFinders 2.0 assessment to get a better understanding of what my strengths are. I think understanding my strengths will help me approach goals in a more effective way. It should also help stir me in the direction that fits best for my career path. 


These are my top 5 themes:

## Input
People who are especially talented in the Input theme have a craving to know more. Often they like to collect and archive all kinds of information.

## Individualization
People who are especially talented in the Individualization theme are intrigued with the unique qualities of each person. They have a gift for figuring out how people who are different can work together productively.

## Empathy
People who are especially talented in the empathy theme can sense the feelings of other people by imagining themselves in others’ lives or others’ situations.

## Discipline
People who are especially talented in the Discipline theme enjoy routine and structure. Their world is best described by the order they create.

## Learner
People who are especially talented in the Learner theme have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. In particular, the process of learning, rather than the outcome, excited them.
