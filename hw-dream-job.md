# 6 Years Later Job Description
With a few years of UX experience under my belt, I can see myself looking to do 2 things: starting my own business or going for a lead UX position. 

As a business owner, I’d like to put together a small team to build a product that could a person’s day-to-day or possibly create a tool to help with education. I’m constantly thinking of ways to working more efficiently as well as help others become more efficient. Building an app or mobile site to help those in a car accident. What are the next steps? 

I get really excited about organizations that are helping young girls get into STEM.  But I also see schools locally losing accreditation because schools do not meet the testing standards. I would love to build something that can help schools gain accreditation back and make learning fun and interesting.

Leading a UX team would be another great possibility. I would love to help organize a team to do great things such as build effective test plans, provide better focus on users’ top priorities, and innovate new features. I want to also help individuals on my team grow as an individual as well as a professional. Whatever her/his next career step would be, regardless if it’s related, I’d love to prepare her/him for that journey.
